# 👋 Introduction 👋

✋ Hello ✋ ! We will be walking you through on how to install the water icons for the water website in case if you are curious or interested. Either way, this will be a calm and easy experience.

# ⚠️ Precauations ⚠️ # 

Before offically installing the water icons, here are some particular aspects to consider before doing so:

1. This is simplified and easy.
2. It will work on any operating system, but on a desktop environment.
3. Requires git to be installed on operating system (Cool installation).
4. Requires download from GitHub (Manual Installation).

# 🆒 Installation (Cool) 🆒 !

Finalization: Alright! You've successfully installed the files with ease using this method (If you did !) You can see other methods down below.

# 💾 Installation (Manual) 💾

4. Extract the ZIP Archive.
5. Open the folder.
6. There you go! Now you can visibly see the icons for water in the folder locally on your computer.


# ℹ️ Info ℹ️

There is an enhanced and the original version (The icons, by the way, were created by OpenAI by myself and then enhanced) which are different from the other in terms of their image quality. The "normal" file will list the original and the "small size" one will indicate that it is the enhanced quality version. 

# ✔️ Finish ✔️

Alright. Now you've completed the installation. Congradulations! Additionally, here is the website (https://h2owater.xyz), where you got this information most likely from. Otherwise, have a great rest of your day!
