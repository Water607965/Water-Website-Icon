# 👋 Introduction 👋

✋ Hello ✋ ! We will be walking you through on how to install the water icons for the water website in case if you are curious or interested. Either way, this will be a calm and easy experience.

# ⚠️ Precauations ⚠️ # 

Before offically installing the water icons, here are some particular aspects to consider before doing so:

1. This is simplified and easy.
2. It will work on any operating system.
3. Requires download from GitHub.

# 🆒 Installation (Cool) 

Copy this following code and paste it into your terminal or command line:

```git clone git@github.com:Water607965/Water-Website-Icon.git```

Afterwards, you can run the following command below, or locate the "Water-Wesbite-Icon" in your files application and locate the folder that holds the files.

```open Water-Website-Icon```

Finalization: Alright! You've successfully installed the files with ease using this method (If you did !) You can see other methods down below.

# 💾 Installation (Manual) 💾

1. Go to the code button on GitHub on this repository ("https://github.com/Water607965/Water-Website-Icon/assets/151555387/4ebc2668-3d05-493e-aa32-2c4a1c117725"), click that link to see an image of where the button is in case you are lost.
2. Click "Download as Zip".
3. Navigate to your download directory (The location in your files where you downloaded the icons).
4. Extract the ZIP Archive.
5. Open the folder.
6. There you go! Now you can visibly see the icons for water in the folder locally on your computer.


# ℹ️ Info ℹ️

There is an enhanced and the original version (The icons, by the way, were created by OpenAI by myself and then enhanced) which are different from the other in terms of their image quality. The "normal" file will list the original and the "small size" one will indicate that it is the enhanced quality version. 

# ✔️ Finish ✔️

Alright. Now you've completed the installation. Congradulations! Additionally, here is the website (https://h2owater.xyz), where you got this information most likely from. Otherwise, have a great rest of your day!
